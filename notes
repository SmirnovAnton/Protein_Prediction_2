Hi, I decided to create this file to use like a chat instead of WhatsApp, so everything is in one place.

Not sure should we go on like that or use "Issues" instead, ideas are wellcome

Update
1) Last week we again didn't present anything - me and Ben couldn't do enough to turn into meaningful presentation
2) From my efforts at least I deduced some reasonable cutoff intervals
-0.9 -0.6 -0.3 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5
the below and above 0 are not the same interval but all provide reasonable change - not to small while not too big
3) I won't be on the lecture tomorrow (Tuesday 5th)
4) There shouldn't be lecture on 7th
5) There is good chance that the exercise on 7th will be cancelled also - check tomorrow with the other groups - they
discussed to send one common e-mail asking to skip the exercise if there won't be a lecture

Sometime tonight or tomorrow I will share my notes on the other teams presentations and discussion for next presentation
